# Work Plan Calendar System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First

**Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and idiomatic.**

- All Python code MUST follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- All JavaScript code MUST follow ES6+ modern standards
- Maximum function complexity: 15 cyclomatic complexity
- Maximum function length: 50 lines (excluding comments/whitespace)
- Meaningful variable/function names required (no single letters except loop iterators)
- Code duplication exceeding 6 lines MUST be refactored into reusable functions
- All public APIs MUST include type hints (Python) or JSDoc comments (JavaScript)
- Dead code and commented-out code MUST be removed before commit

**Rationale**: The calendar system manages critical user planning data. Poor code quality leads to bugs that disrupt user workflows, making the system unreliable. Maintainability ensures long-term sustainability as features grow.

### II. Testing Standards

**Tests MUST verify correctness at contract, integration, and edge-case levels.**

- All API endpoints MUST have contract tests validating request/response schemas
- All user stories MUST have integration tests covering happy path scenarios
- Critical business logic (date calculations, plan navigation) MUST have unit tests
- Edge cases MUST be tested: boundary dates (year/month/week transitions), empty plans, concurrent saves
- Test coverage target: minimum 80% for backend services, 70% for frontend components
- Tests MUST be independent and runnable in any order
- Test failures MUST provide clear diagnostic messages indicating what failed and why
- Mock external dependencies; do not require filesystem writes in unit tests (use temp directories)

**Rationale**: Calendar date calculations are notoriously error-prone (leap years, week boundaries, timezone handling). User trust depends on correct plan retrieval and storage. Comprehensive tests prevent data loss and calculation errors.

### III. User Experience Consistency

**User interactions MUST be predictable, accessible, and error-tolerant.**

- All user actions MUST provide immediate visual feedback (loading states, save confirmations)
- Error messages MUST be user-friendly, actionable, and never expose stack traces
- Keyboard shortcuts MUST work consistently across all panels (Ctrl+S saves, Ctrl+E toggles edit/preview)
- Responsive design breakpoints: mobile (<640px), tablet (640-1024px), desktop (>1024px)
- All interactive elements MUST have accessible labels and ARIA attributes
- Auto-save MUST trigger 3 seconds after last keystroke; manual save MUST be instant
- Plan navigation (previous/next) MUST preserve context (same plan type, edit state)
- Loading states MUST appear for operations exceeding 200ms
- Markdown rendering MUST be consistent between editor preview and saved view

**Rationale**: Users rely on this system daily for planning critical work. Inconsistent behavior or confusing errors disrupt their workflow and reduce trust. Accessibility ensures all users can benefit from the system.

### IV. Performance Requirements

**System MUST respond quickly and handle reasonable scale without degradation.**

- API response time: <100ms p50, <300ms p95 for plan CRUD operations
- Frontend rendering: Initial page load <1.5s, subsequent navigations <500ms
- Auto-save debounce: 3 seconds (prevent excessive API calls during typing)
- Markdown rendering: <200ms for plans up to 10,000 characters
- Backend MUST handle 50 concurrent users without degradation
- File I/O operations MUST use async patterns to prevent blocking
- Database queries (if added) MUST use indexes on date fields
- Memory usage: Backend <200MB per process, frontend <50MB heap per session
- No memory leaks: Long-running sessions (8+ hours) MUST not accumulate memory

**Rationale**: A slow planning tool disrupts focus and productivity. Users often switch rapidly between dates and plan types during review sessions. Performance degradation makes the system frustrating to use.

## Performance Targets

### Backend Performance

- **Endpoint Latency**:
  - GET /api/plans/{type}/{date}: <50ms p50, <150ms p95
  - POST/PUT /api/plans/{type}/{date}: <100ms p50, <250ms p95
  - DELETE operations: <75ms p50, <200ms p95
  - Navigation endpoints (previous/next): <80ms p50, <200ms p95

- **Throughput**: Minimum 100 requests/second on single instance
- **File Operations**: Markdown file read/write <30ms per operation
- **Concurrency**: Support 50 concurrent API requests without queuing

### Frontend Performance

- **Initial Load**: <1.5s for first meaningful paint
- **Interactions**: <100ms response to user clicks
- **Rendering**: <200ms to render markdown preview
- **Auto-save**: Debounce 3s, network request <150ms
- **Navigation**: <500ms to load and render new plan view

### Resource Limits

- **Backend Memory**: <200MB per FastAPI worker process
- **Frontend Memory**: <50MB JavaScript heap per browser session
- **Bundle Size**: JavaScript <150KB gzipped, CSS <30KB gzipped
- **API Payload**: Maximum 1MB per plan document

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements

- All changes MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Reviews MUST verify compliance with all four core principles
- Automated tests MUST pass before review approval
- Linting and formatting checks MUST pass (flake8 for Python, ESLint for JavaScript)

### Quality Gates

- **Pre-commit**: Formatting and linting checks pass
- **Pre-push**: All tests pass locally
- **CI Pipeline**: Tests, linting, type checking, coverage validation
- **Pre-deployment**: Integration tests pass, performance benchmarks met

### Feature Development Process

1. Specification: Define user stories, requirements, success criteria
2. Planning: Technical design, task breakdown, dependency analysis
3. Test Design: Write failing tests for contracts and integration scenarios
4. Implementation: Write code to pass tests, refactor for quality
5. Validation: Verify all principles, run full test suite, performance check
6. Documentation: Update README, API docs, inline comments

### Documentation Standards

- All API endpoints MUST be documented in OpenAPI/Swagger format
- All JavaScript modules MUST have file-level JSDoc comments explaining purpose
- Complex algorithms (especially date calculations) MUST have inline comments explaining logic
- README MUST be kept current with setup instructions, architecture overview, and feature list

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Any deviation from these principles MUST be explicitly justified and documented in the implementation plan's Complexity Tracking section.

### Amendment Process

- Amendments MUST include rationale for the change
- Version number MUST be incremented following semantic versioning:
  - MAJOR: Principle removal or redefinition (backward incompatible)
  - MINOR: New principle or section added
  - PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements
- Amendments MUST trigger updates to affected templates and command files
- All stakeholders MUST be notified of constitutional changes

### Compliance Verification

- All pull requests MUST include a Constitution Compliance section verifying adherence
- Code reviews MUST explicitly check for principle violations
- CI/CD pipeline MUST enforce automated compliance (tests, linting, coverage)
- Quarterly audits MUST review codebase for accumulated technical debt

### Exception Handling

Violations MUST be justified in the implementation plan with:
- Why the principle cannot be followed
- Simpler alternative considered and rejected
- Mitigation plan to minimize impact
- Future refactoring plan to eliminate violation
